# U(N) Wilson / Holonomy

**ID:** `eq-un-wilson-holonomy`  
**Tier:** derived  
**Score:** 56  
**Units:** WARN  
**Theory:** PASS-WITH-ASSUMPTIONS  

## Equation

$$
U(\gamma)=\mathcal{P}\exp\!\Big(-\oint_\gamma A\cdot d\lambda\Big)\in U(N)
$$

## Description

Path-ordered exponential giving the U(N) holonomy around a closed loop γ. Extends the Phase-Lift framework beyond the U(1) case to non-abelian gauge fields.

## Assumptions

- Connection A is smooth (or piecewise smooth) along γ.
- Path ordering P is needed for non-abelian A (order matters).
- N > 1 generalization remains speculative without concrete experimental targets.
